# maze
Using BFS and DFS to find the goal in a maze

- maze.py was taken from Harvard's CS50AI course on Search.

- I modified it as maze_ben.ipynb to return results from both search methods (BFS and DFS) from maze4.txt which was modified from maze2.txt.

- Future plans to include Greedy-first search and A* search after finishing the 2 projects on Degrees-of-separation(private) and Tic-tac-toe(private).
